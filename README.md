This program synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The program should maintain a full, identical copy of source 
folder at replica folder. This program is written in Python.

Synchronization is one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder is modified to exactly match content of the source 
folder. Synchronization is performed periodically.
